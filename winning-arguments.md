# Winning Arguments

The phrase "winning arguments" has at least two important senses.

First, it can be interpreted to refer to an activity, the activity of winning arguments, where "argument" here is used in the sense of "debate."

Second, "winning arguments" can be interpreted as a noun phrase, where "argument" is used in the sense meaning "a series of statements designed to provide reasons to believe that some conclusion(s) are true." In this interpretation of the phrase, "winning" is an adjective.

A great deal of importance has been introduced in the preceding two paragraphs, so let's unpack them.  

The first item of importance is the distinction between two senses of the word "argument." Arguments in the first sense are debates. Arguments in the second sense are series of statements designed to provide reasons to believe that some conclusion(s) are true. Henceforth, in this text we will consistently use the term "argument" to refer to arguments in the second sense, and we will use the term "debate" to refer to arguments in the first sense.
