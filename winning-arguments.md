# Winning Arguments

## How to use this text

You can use this text as a practical guide to winning arguments, to reasoning about any subject, to seeking the truth about any subject, and to misleading people about any subject.

The text is a philosophical study of language, reasoning, argumentation, and related topics, with the practical aim stated above. The same theories that explain how to win arguments on any subject also explain how to reason about any subject, how to seek the truth about any subject, and how to mislead people about any subject. The same knowledge can be used for any of these purposes, and it's up to the person who has it to use it responsibly.

The author advises the reader against the use of any techniques to deliberately mislead people, as the author believes misleading people almost invariably leads, in the long haul, to consequences more deplorable than what would have resulted if one told the truth.

The text contains exercises, which the author feels will be likely to further the reader's learning, and which the reader is encouraged to do when they feel they will further their learning. The greatest exercise, of course, is life, where you can fruitfully exercise the skills of reasoning, critical thinking, and argumentation you can learn in this text in almost any context of life.

This text is meant to be read from start to finish without skipping around. It is cumulative; each piece builds upon preceding pieces. In general you shouldn't expect to fully understand a part of the text unless you understand the text up to that point. 

For those who have not read much philosophy before, I apologize for the plodding and abstract nature of the text, which will probably be a challenge for some people new to philosophy. I would like to offer some words of advice on how to read the text.

* Start out by reading one sentence at a time. Make sure you understand what each sentence is saying, before moving onto the next sentence. You can relax this rule if you're comfortable that you're following the text.
* If you understand what's being said but not why it's being said, you can just plow forward and imagine it will eventually become clear. I considered it too complex and distracting to try to explain, before each thing that's said, why it's being said. Therefore I ask for the reader's trust that they are being led on a purposeful path towards my understanding of winning arguments. If we take a shortcut through a strange, dark tunnel where the reader can only see two inches in front of their face, the reader is asked to take courage and keep their attention on those two inches.
* If there's a sentence or a section that's giving you too much difficulty, you can skip it.
* If you get totally lost and stop being able to follow what's being said, you can go back to the last point in the text up to which you're comfortable you've understood things, and re-read from there.
* If you come across a word you don't know, whose meaning you can't infer from context, then you should look up a definition for the word.
* If you come across a word whose meaning you don't know in the particular context it's used, then look for a standard dictionary definition of the word and see if that fits.

To those who are new to philosophy, I recommend patience with the speed of one's understanding if it proves to try one's patience. Philosophical thoughts are usually developed by going over the same problems again and again over the course of years, and understanding philosophical writing often requires reading it multiple times and thinking about it over time.

In this text we will engage in an activity we call "conceptual analysis." Conceptual analysis is analysis of the meaning of words or concepts with the aim of clarifying their meaning and understanding it more deeply. In general, and in this text, conceptual analysis falls somewhere between the two poles of purely *descriptive* analysis, describing how various people have used a word or concept, and purely *prescriptive* analysis, defining a precise meaning for the term which the author uses and argues that readers should use.

Descriptive conceptual analysis is useful for uncovering the many layers of meaning that are often present in everyday terms. Prescriptive conceptual analysis, used judiciously, is useful for establishing clear communication and laying linguistic foundations that can be built on. A gentle and careful blending of descriptive and prescriptive conceptual analysis provides, in my experience, a powerful and versatile ingredient for philosophical argumentation. This text is or aims to be, among other things, a study in the method of conceptual analysis, and a large proportion of the text is conceptual analysis.

## Introduction

Winning arguments is what we aim to show how to do in this text. We will show how this can be done by constructing winning arguments. As just illustrated, the phrase "winning arguments" has at least two important senses.

First, "winning arguments" can be interpreted to refer to an activity, the activity of winning arguments, where "argument" here is used in the sense of "debate."

Second, "winning arguments" can be interpreted as a noun phrase, where "argument" is used in the sense of "a series of statements designed to provide reason to believe some conclusion(s)." In this interpretation of the phrase, "winning" is an adjective, presumably meaning something like "persuasive."

A great deal of importance has been introduced in the preceding three paragraphs, so let's unpack the ideas further.

The first item of importance is the distinction between two senses of the word "argument."

Arguments in the first sense of the word are debates. By "debates," I mean exchanges of communication where participants discuss with each other the merits and demerits of some claims that they are mutually interested in and believe themselves to disagree about.

Arguments in the second sense of the term are series of statements designed to provide reason to believe some conclusion(s). Henceforth, in this text we will consistently use the term "argument" to refer to arguments in this second sense, and we will use the term "debate" in order to retire the first sense of the term "argument."

Here is an example of an argument:

**(Question Science)** You shouldn't uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across. [Ioannidis (2005)](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) is a scientific study which claims that most published research findings are false. If you should uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across, then you should accept Ioannidis (2005). But if you uncritically accept Ioannidis (2005), then you accept that most scientific studies draw false conclusions. That means you shouldn't uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across, because if you do, you can expect to be adopting a lot of false beliefs.

Let's analyze this argument, which we will refer to as Question Science. Question Science seeks to prove that you should not uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across. It proceeds by assuming for the sake of argument the opposite of what it seeks to prove, and deriving an absurd result. It assumes for the sake of argument that we should uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies we come across, and ends by deriving the absurd conclusion that you should do something which will lead to you adopting a lot of false beliefs.

Let's step through the argument. We begin with the assumption for the sake of argument that you should uncritically accept all scientific studies you come across. The next move is based on the observation that if somebody thinks that way, you can make them believe anything that's said in a published scientific paper. The next move is to point out a paper, Ioannidis (2005), which will make us believe, under our sake-of-argument assumption, that most scientific studies conclude things that are false. This tells us that the thing we assumed we should do will lead us to hold many false beliefs. With the further assumption that we should not uncritically accept information that's likely to be false, we can refute the statement that we started out by assuming. In other words we can conclude that we should not uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies we come across.

Question Science is an example of a *reductio ad absurdum* argument. A *reductio ad absurdum* argument, in a strict sense, is one that proceeds by assuming the negation of its conclusion, and deriving a logical contradiction thereby. In a looser sense, a *reductio ad absurdum* argument can derive, instead of a logical contradiction, an absurd consequence that will probably be unacceptable to the audience of the argument, leading the audience to reject the assumption that leads to that consequence.

Question Science is a *reductio ad absurdum* argument in the looser sense. In the argument above, we first assume the view we wish to refute, and with a modest amount of information and background assumptions, we get to the conclusion that our assumption will likely lead us to accept many false things as true, something which makes most people want to back out of the assumption.

Question Science is an example of a winning argument. I expect the reader agrees: it is hard to disagree with the reasoning, or the conclusion. I haven't encountered anybody who finds this argument unpersuasive. One reason the argument is so strong is the simplicity and effectiveness of its structure, which is based on the *reductio ad absurdum* idea that is the basis of many good arguments stretching back to ancient times.

Let's round out this discussion with an example of an argument which is a *reductio ad absurdum* in the strict sense: that is, an argument which proceeds by assuming the opposite of that which it seeks to prove, and deriving a logical contradiction from that assumption. As our example, we will do an informal version of the classic proof, due to Euclid, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

**(Infinitude of Primes)** Recall that a prime number is a positive whole number which is divisible only by itself and one. Suppose, towards reaching a contradiction, that there are finitely many prime numbers. Let x be the number resulting from multiplying together all the prime numbers and adding one. Since x is evidently larger than all prime numbers, x is not prime. The fact that x is not prime means, by definition, that x is divisible by at least one prime number. Pick a prime that x is divisible by, and call it p. We know that the remainder of dividing x by p is 0, since that's what it means for x to be divisible by p. However, we also know that the remainder of dividing x by p is 1, because of how we produced x. This is a contradiction, demonstrating that our original assumption was false, or in other words that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Why is it true (at the second to last sentence of the argument) that the remainder of dividing x by p is 1? We produced x by multiplying together all the (finitely many) prime numbers and adding one. Therefore p goes into (x-1) evenly, i.e. the remainder of the division (x-1)/p is zero, and therefore the remainder of the division x/p is 1.

Infinitude of Primes is another example of a winning argument. Mathematical theorems, like the theorem that there are infinitely many prime numbers, are extraordinarily uncontroversial. As we will see later, this can be explained in part by the statement that math is a game that has simple and essentially agreed upon rules. By describing math as a game, I do not mean to imply that math is not an activity of seeking truth. I don't mean to take any position in this text on whether or not math is an activity of seeking the truth.

Nonetheless, correct mathematical proofs are some of the best examples we have of winning arguments, due to their persuasive power and their ability to quell mathematical controversy across recorded history. People of all known times and cultures have been seen by historians of math to have mutually consistent understandings of math in almost all respects, whereas such agreement can be observed in few other areas of study. CITATION NEEDED

We've dug a bit into the concept of arguments, in the sense of series of statements designed to provide reason to believe some conclusion(s). Let's now return to the distinction we made between debates and arguments.

Debates almost always involve the participants making arguments. Can arguments occur anywhere except in the context of debates? 

One place where you can find arguments is in books, especially non-fiction books. One can argue that an argument in a book is not in the context of any particular debate, because a book is an inanimate object that can exist in many copies in different places and times. Books are objects which are incapable of participating reciprocally in debates. You can, in a certain sense, let a book make arguments to you by reading it. You can also respond to the book's arguments, mentally, in your journal, to other people, to the author, etc. But the book cannot respond to your responses to its arguments. The author might be able to, if they're still alive, but that's another issue. This is what I mean when I say that books cannot participate reciprocally in debates. For these and many other reasons, you might say that arguments in books do not necessarily occur in the context of any debate, or perhaps that they never do.

Nonetheless, you might argue that arguments in books usually do occur in the context of some debate or another. This idea is palatable if we accept, as examples of debates, ongoing public debates. An ongoing public debate on a question, roughly, is a situation where lots of people make arguments on and have debates on the question, across a significant slice of space and time, probably across a region or the world for years. If you accept ongoing public debates as examples of debates, then you will probably accept that most arguments in most books occur in the context of some debate.

A possible exception to this generalization is the (hypothetical) case where somebody writes a book which makes arguments on a topic nobody else has discussed, and then nobody reads the book. In this case, you could for the sake of uniformity say that the book occurs in the context of a debate involving one person, the author. However, this might be odd to say because there seems to be something inherently interactive, social, multi-personal about debates. I think most people are going to be inclined to say that the arguments in this book do not occur in the context of any debate.

The possibility of such an exception to the generalization that arguments in books occur in the context of some debate makes more sense when we consider the plausibility of the idea that an argument in a book can occur in the context of multiple debates. For example, a single book about climate change can be involved in the overall public debate on climate change, while simultaneously being involved in many particular interpersonal debates about climate change, each occurring between a specific group of people together in one location in physical space or cyberspace. It seems reasonable to talk in this way and to say that the book is involved in multiple debates on one subject. If the number of debates a book is involved in can vary in number, then it seems only natural that the number could in principle equal zero, though that probably isn't common in reality.

So far we've reached three generalizations about the relationship between arguments and debates:

* Arguments usually occur in the context of debates.
* Debates usually contain arguments.
* Arguments can, in principle, occur outside the context of debates.

In my estimation, all of these points are important. That arguments usually occur in the context of debates, and debates usually contain arguments, tells us that arguments and debates are importantly related to each other and we need to understand them together. That arguments can, in principle, occur outside the context of debates tells us that arguments can be understood independently from debates (though it doesn't tell us whether that's the most useful way to understand them). It's probably not the case, on the other hand, that debates can be understood independently from arguments, since skilled debates are almost always in essence exchanges of arguments.

We will take both of the available approaches to understanding arguments. One can understand arguments either within the context of debates, or independently from debates. We will do both. It's very helpful to study arguments in what we will call the *context-free perspective,* i.e. outside the context of debates. This perspective helps us focus in on arguments' intrinsic properties, and thereby understand arguments much better. However, the perspective is unbalanced if we don't also study arguments in the *contextful perspective*, i.e. in the context of debates as they occur in reality.

Hopefully that discussion of the relationships between debates and arguments has clarified for the reader the distinction between debates and arguments, as well as helping to clarify each concept individually.

Let's return to our original task of clarifying the meaning of the first three paragraphs of this Introduction. So far we've clarified the meanings of two critical words, "debate" and "argument." Yet many words of nebulous, dubious, or unclear meaning remain. First and foremost, "winning," but also (with the evident nebulousness, dubiousness or unclarity depending in part on where and how deep you've traveled into philosophy) "true," "reason," "believe," "persuasive," and "statement." Let's analyze the meanings of these words, starting with "winning."

What is winning? For starters, winning is most often something that happens to people in the context of games (chess, baseball, etc.).

Question: is winning something that ever happens to people *except* in the context of some game?

To make a start on what's going to be a highly roundabout answer to this question, let's consider the phrase "winning at life." Winning at life is a form of winning, at least on a surface inspection of the phrase. One can also hypothesize that "winning at life" is in some usages a phrase with its own particular meaning that doesn't decompose as winning in the context of life, in the same way that a "close shave" doesn't always refer to a shave that was close.

If winning at life is winning in the context of life, and winning only ever happens in the context of some game, then it follows that life is a game. So, then, is life a game? 

"Life is a game" is a truism, a statement that people are liable to spout as a form of shallow wisdom, perhaps without much reflection on how true it really is. How true is the truism? To answer that, we need to ask, what does the truism mean? To answer that, we need to ask, what do the words in the truism "life is a game" mean? "Life" seems to refer to human life, and probably it's clear enough what we're referring to there. What about "game?"

## Games

What is a game? Let's try to make a start on this question by identifying some things that are games, and also some things that are not games, which fail to be games in ways that are interesting and tell us something about games. A lot of the judgment as to which is which is going to be subjective, but the judgments on particular cases aren't in the end the important thing, but rather what's important is the general picture of games that emerges from the analysis.

Popular and typical examples of games include soccer, chess, poker, dice, solitaire, World of Warcraft, and slot machines. Childrens' games include [peekaboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekaboo), [tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)), [ring around the rosie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_a_Ring_o'_Roses), and two people sitting on the ground and rolling a ball back and forth between each other. Unusual examples of games include [war games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise), the [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games), [Roman gladiatorial combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator), TV game or reality shows such as [The Celebrity Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Celebrity_Apprentice), [Chopped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_(TV_series)#Format), and [Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(game_show)), and abstract theoretical games like the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) which are studied in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). There's a whole category of more analogical usages of "game," such as the game of life, the game of capitalism, the game of courtship and romantic love, and the game of war.

From this list we can immediately state some generalizations that are not true about all games. Not all games are frivolous in purpose; some, such as war games, are serious in purpose. Even games that are superficially frivolous in purpose can be games where you're competing for your own life, as shown by the example of Roman gladiatorial combat. Non-lethal games can involve considerable stakes of money and glory, as exemplified in professional poker and in the Olympic Games.

Roman gladiatorial combat was a game played to entertain people. In that sense it was frivolous in purpose. But, it was gruesome, violent, lethal, and expensive, so presumably there was some significant reason people went to the trouble and difficulty of putting on the games.

One hypothesis I've heard is the following. Rome contained a large class of poor people who lived on welfare and therefore were not occupied with useful work, and it was found to be necessary to entertain them to prevent them from engaging in crime and disruption. If this was the primary purpose of the games for some of the people who funded them, then certainly there was nothing frivolous about the games for those funders. For the people watching the games, the main purpose seems to have been entertainment.

Another hypothesis one can put forth is that the gladiatorial games embodied the Roman values of violence, domination, and heroism, and like most civilizations the Romans felt it was a worthwhile effort to put on events which could stand as monuments to their values. If we think of this as the primary purpose of the games, then one's inclined to say that the purpose is not frivolous, either for the funders or for the audience members.

If you think of the funders and the watchers of the Roman gladiatorial games as different sets of players in the game (expanding the conceptual boundaries of the game beyond the combat ring itself), one can venture that for the funders, the purpose of the games was often not frivolous, whereas for the watchers, the purpose of the games was most often the frivolous purpose of entertainment.

I am not asserting that any of these interpretations of the purposes of the Roman gladiatorial games are correct. However, each of these interpretations could (from a perspective of ignorance of relevant historical facts) be correct, and each one is a conceptually possible example of the purposes of a game.

The example of the Roman games illustrates the principle that a game can have multiple purposes, some explicit and some implicit, and different players in a game can have different purposes. The explicit purpose(s) of a game, being explicit, are typically apparent to all. In contrast, probably in almost all cases it's unclear to all or almost all observers of a game what all of the implicit purposes of the game are. This is because implicit purposes are, by definition, not stated, and since we can't read each other's thoughts we have no reliable way of knowing each other's unstated motivations.

Furthermore, people can be unaware of their own motivations. It is widely agreed, including among experts in psychology, that most of people's mental activity is unconscious, i.e. not witnessed or observed by their conscious minds. This consensus holds that among people's motivations for things they do, there are their unconscious motivations. Some argue that most or all things we do are influenced at least in part, or even mostly, by unconscious motivations.

This is not a psychology text, and we won't try to answer the question of in what ways and to what extent people's behavior is influenced by unconscious motivations. However, if the reader agrees that unconscious motivations exist, then we can say that a game may have an implicit purpose of which no observers have any awareness.

Given our limited access to our own minds, and our near lack of access to others' minds, it's clear why probably in almost all cases it's unclear to all or almost all observers of a game what all of the implicit purposes of the game are.

Let's now switch gears and poke at one of the more dubious examples we gave of a game, to see what we can learn about games in the process.

TODO: Explain prisoner's dilemma and address whether it's a game

Let's now switch gears again. Let's give some examples of things that are not games, which fail to be games in interesting ways that might tell us something about games.

Here's an example of a non-game: making toast. If you are a native English speaker: does it sound natural to describe making toast as a game? For me, the answer is that it does not sound natural. Making toast is not a game. It's some other kind of activity. Food preparation.

Here are some more examples of activities that are not usually called games: fixing your toaster; driving to work; working; sleeping; having sex; thinking; conversation; serving on a jury in a court of law; voting. People don't usually call any of these things games, and yet many of them have certain similarities to games. Serving on a jury and voting both have game-like qualities, being group activities governed by socially agreed upon systems of rules within which people make decisions in order to fulfill the objective of the activity (making a fair decision on the case being presented, or electing representatives and resolving plebiscites, respectively). Conversation, and language use in general, have many game-like qualities, being subject to many elaborate, unspoken rules. Game-like activities can be found strewn throughout life if you look for them.

We have collected some examples and non-examples of games, and we have a substantial middle ground of things that arguably have both gamelike and non-gamelike qualities, including voting, serving on a jury, and, usually, working. Let's use this data to evaluate some possible generalizations about games.

**Do games always have rules?** Can we think of an example of a game that has no rules? Conversation, one might argue, is a game with no rules. In some sense this is true; people are free to say whatever they want. However, conversation does have many unstated norms that are usually not violated.

TODO: Below is sloppy, make better

One of the norms that most conversations can (at least in my experience) be observed to follow is that when talking about a subject, one should not make a statement on a new subject until nobody still has a statement to make on the current subject, unless an interruption from the environment requires a change of subject. In the case of an interruption from the environment, the norm usually followed in the conversations I observe is to return to the same point in the suspended conversation where the interruption occurred, once the interruption has been dealt with.

Besides such conversational norms of speaking priority, which are I'm sure not universal to all conversations, each conversation will invariably follow many rules of grammar and prononunciation particular to the language(s) being used in the conversation. These are further examples of rules that conversations follow. Therefore we can say that conversations have rules. Therefore we can say the game of conversation is not a counterexample to the claim that games always have rules.

Other counterexamples I'm aware of can be disposed of in similar ways. It looks to me like any appearance of a gamelike activity lacking rules is due to failure to look sufficiently broadly for rules governing the activity. In interpreting this statement, it should be understood that rules need not be inviolable to be rules.

When speaking English, people usually follow rules of grammar. Sometimes people violate the rules of grammar they normally follow. Folk vernaculars of English can have their own grammars different from standard English grammar, but in most cases those grammars have their own internal consistencies. [TODO: Citation needed] In addition, there is more than one standard English, as there is standard British English, standard American English, and so forth. This illustrates that there is a great deal of complexity and inconsistency when it comes to rules of English grammar. We can still say as a generalization that English speakers, and speakers of every other language, follow the rules of grammar particular to their dialects most of the time when speaking. This illustrates the nuance that can apply when discussing the rules of games. Rules of games can be very flexible and granular in scope.

So far as our discussion has led us to be able to see, the generalization is true that **games and gamelike activities follow rules**. If there are exceptions to this generalization, they seem to be obscure.

The nature of rules is well worth exploring in more depth. However, in order to complete our discussion of games, so that we can move on to discuss our primary topic of winning, we will delay discussing the nature of rules in more depth.

**Are games always competitive?** The answer appears to be **no**. For some childrens' games, such as [peekaboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekaboo) and and [ring around the rosie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_a_Ring_o'_Roses), it's difficult to see any sense in which they are competitive. However, most games are competitive in some sense. Even solitary games usually involve self-competition, trying to learn and do better.

**Are games always cooperative?** Any game which involves multiple people is cooperative in the sense that playing a game requires the players to agree to play the game (as opposed to doing anything else), to put effort towards its execution, and to abide by the rules of the game. Therefore we can conclude that multi-player games are always cooperative on some level, and usually competitive on another level. Jordan Peterson made this point in one of his lectures for his course Maps of Meaning, available on YouTube (sorry I can't provide a more specific citation). He gave an example much like what follows. In a game of hockey, the members of each team cooperate with each other in their competition with the other team. In addition, the members of each team compete with their team mebers for position in the meritocracy of the team. Finally, all the players cooperate with each other in their agreement to play the game and in their execution of gameplay according to the rules. There are a number of different levels of cooperation and competition in this case.

In solitary games the obvious comment would be that there is no cooperation because cooperation requires multiple people. This is true in an obvious sense. However, it's also false in a less obvious sense, in that playing a game requires internal coordination on the part of a person. In order to play a game, a person has to coordinate the different parts of their mind and body to focus them towards a single task. In the same sense, every activity whatsoever done by a person involves self-cooperation. One could fairly object that self-cooperation is an undue extension of the term "cooperation," and I will not press the point.

What conclusion are we led to about whether games are always cooperative? In this case we're led to **no single conclusion**. What we've said indicates that if self-cooperation is a form of cooperation, then games are always cooperative, and on the other hand, if self-cooperation is not a form of cooperation, then games are not always cooperative. In addition, what we've said indicates that multi-player games are always cooperative.

What can we say overall about the meaning of the word "game?" On this, let's quote from Wittgenstein, in the Philosophical Investigations, part I, remarks 66-67:

"66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call "games". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?—Don't say: "There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games' "—but look and see whether there is anything common to all.—For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think, but look!—Look for example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass to card-games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ballgames, much that is common is retained, but much is lost.—Are they all 'amusing'? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear.

"And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail."

"67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than "family resemblances"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way.—And I shall say: **'games' form a family**." [emphasis added]

## Rules and laws

We have agreed that games always have rules. However, we have not discussed at any length what rules are. Understanding rules is quite central to understanding games, and to understanding the principles of winning arguments. To understand rules, it is also helpful to compare the meaning of the word "rule" with the meaning of the word "law." Since the terms are close in meaning, comparing and contrasting the meanings of the terms is informative about both. Therefore we will embark on a unified analysis of rules and laws.

There are many different laws and sets of laws of varying kinds, degrees, and scopes of importance and validity. Examples of laws (or at any rate things that people call laws) include: the [laws and regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_legislation) of each [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)), [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_division), [municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality), and so forth; religious systems of law such as [sharia law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia), the [Ten Commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments) and [Talmudic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism); the laws of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), and other fields of study which have produced laws; satirical laws like [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law) and [Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law); sociological laws like [Duverger's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law); mystical laws like the [law of attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_(New_Thought)) and the [Law of One](http://www.lawofone.info/synopsis.php); and so forth. 

[Examples of rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule) (or at any rate things that people call rules) include, firstly, the rules of any game. Secondly, there are many rules (or things that people call rules) which are not literally rules of any game, such as: the [M'Naghten rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M'Naghten_rules); the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule); the [five-second rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-second_rule) and other [rules of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb); [unspoken rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspoken_rule); [rules of etiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette); and rules of inference in logic (which we shall discuss at length later).

What kinds of things can follow rules? Clearly humans can follow rules. Systems of physical objects can follow rules, as for example all systems of medium-sized physical objects follow the laws of Newtonian physics. Arguments can follow rules; for example, an argument can be logically valid, meaning it proceeds only according to logically correct rules of inference. Correct, fully detailed mathematical proofs are examples of logically valid arguments. In short, many things, human and non-human, can obey rules.

I am not aware of any counterexamples to the following generalization: all (things we ordinarily call) rules are defined and established by humans.

This generalization does not necessarily extend to laws. Many laws are clearly defined and established by humans, such as the laws of the legal systems of states, regions, and municipalities. Other laws, arguably, are not defined and established by humans:

* Though descriptions of physical theories such as Newtonian physics are products of humans, some would argue that Newtonian physics (or some hypothetical complete physical theory) is a description of laws of nature that exist objectively, independently of humans, regardless of whether we know about said laws. If laws of nature exist objectively, then they weren't established by humans.
* Many would argue that systems of religious law, such as sharia law or the Ten Commandments, were created by God and therefore not defined or established by humans.

In summary, some but arguably not all laws are defined and established by humans, whereas essentially all things people call rules are defined and established by humans, so far as the author knows.

There is some potential overlap between the categories of rules and laws. For example, the following statement seems fair: the laws of Newtonian physics are rules describing the motion of physical bodies. From that statement it follows that the laws of Newtonian physics are both rules and laws. If we accept that there are many (or in fact any) things which we can reasonably call either rules or laws, then it follows that there are no properties which all rules have and all laws lack, or vice versa.

Is every rule a law? Is every law a rule? "The laws of chess" and "the rules of the universe" are odd sounding phrases, probably, to most native English speakers. "The laws of chess" sounds odd, perhaps, because it suggests that the rules of chess have some quality of inevitability, whereas in fact people regularly play [variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960) [of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_chess) [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants), cheat at chess, misunderstand the rules of chess, etc. "The rules of the universe" sounds odd, perhaps, because there's nothing we ordinarily call a rule that governs something as big and grand as the universe; only things we ordinarily call laws apply at this scale. These phrases, "the laws of chess" and "the rules of the universe," are still probably understandable in context, and they need not have the illogical connations we have described for them, but they can refer simply to the rules of chess and the laws of biology.

Our linguistic experiments suggest, firstly, that there is a delicate difference in meaning between "rule" and "law," and secondly, that there is a great deal of similarity in meaning between "rule" and "law."

The similarity in meaning between "rule" and "law" is so great that one hypothesis one might venture is that "rule" and "law" are essentially different words for the same concept, which we apply habitually to different kinds of things, without any deeper distinction. One way of describing the hypothesized vague, habitual distinction is to observe that laws are usually broad in their domain of applicability, whereas rules are usually narrow in their domain of applicability.

One objection to the view that "rule" and "law" are essentially the same concept is as follows. All things we habitually call rules seem to be made by humans. A qualifier to this is that rules can also be made by the creations of humans, as when computer programs generate rules for other programs to follow. Rules govern humans and the operations of the creations of humans. Laws, on the other hand, according to the objection, are not always created by humans, and sometimes they govern nature rather than humans or the creations of humans. If one accepts the foregoing, then one will acknowledge a substantive distinction between rules and laws.

For the sake of clear nomenclature, we will use the term "natural law" to refer to laws which are not created by humans. By definition, then, natural laws include any laws created by God, if God exists. I am not assuming that any natural laws exist, but we have a word for any that do exist (as well as any that don't exist).

The nature and extent of the difference in meaning between "rule" and "law" is, at the end of the day, a question of opinion. The subtleties of the distinction are interesting. What's perhaps more interesting, though, is looking deeper into the basic meanings of the terms "rule" and "law." Let's see if we can look into the heart of the term "rule" to see what we find, and then let's see if we can find something different in the heart of the term "law."

It would be helpful to establish more relations between "rule" and other terms we have studied. We have generalized that games and gamelike activities follow rules. Can we also generalize that rules occur in the context of games and gamelike activities?

Let's look back to the examples of rules we gave. Do all of them occur in the context of games or gamelike activities? Let's examine. The M'Naghten rules are rules for legal proceedings, which are a gamelike activity used to settle legal cases. The right-hand rule is a mini-game for remembering orientation conventions in 3D vector math. The five-second rule is a mini-game (lacking any factual basis) which we play to justify eating food off the floor. The [rule of 72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72) is a rule of thumb that one can employ in the gamelike activity of investment portfolio construction. One illustration that investment portfolio construction is a gamelike activity is that [a number of games](https://www.google.com/?q=stock+market+simulator) have been closely modeled after the activity of trading the stock market. Trading the stock market has, in turn, drawn comparison to gambling games such as poker.

Bearing in mind the flexibility of the concept "game or gamelike activity," it seems fair to generalize that rules occur in the context of games or gamelike activities. This generalization gives us further conceptual bearing for thinking about rules: we can always think about rules in the context of games or gamelike activities.

This generalization is violated by the statement "the laws of Newtonian physics are rules governing the motion of physical bodies," if we consider the laws of Newtonian physics to be objective features of nature rather than a human-constructed system for understanding nature. In other words, at least one of these four things is false:

1. Rules always occur in the context of games or gamelike activities.
2. The laws of Newtonian physics are objective features of nature rather than a human-constructed system for understanding nature.
3. The laws of Newtonian physics are rules.
4. Nature itself is not a gamelike activity.

If statements 1-3 are true, then we can conclude that nature itself is a gamelike activity, since if the laws of Newtonian physics are objective features of nature, then the context to which they apply is nature itself. If the laws of Newtonian physics are rules, then it follows that nature itself is a gamelike activity, in direct contradiction of statement 4. Hence, we are required by logic to reject at least one of statements 1-4.

All of these statements can be thought of as terminological rules. Statement 1 says that if we're willing to call something a rule, we should be willing to call its context a game or gamelike activity. Statement 3 says we should be willing to refer to the laws of Newtonian physics as rules. Statement 4 says we should not be willing to describe nature itself as a gamelike activity.

Statement 2 is a compound of a terminological rule and a statement about the world. We can think of it as a combination into one statement of the following two statements:

**Statement 2w:** There are objective laws of nature correlating to human-constructed descriptions of the laws of Newtonian physics.

**Statement 2t:** We should use the phrase "the laws of Newtonian physics" to refer to said objective laws of nature, as opposed to using the phrase "the laws of Newtonian physics" to refer to said human-constructed descriptions.

For statement 2t to make sense, statement 2w must be true. If statement 2w is not true, then there are no objective laws of nature correlating to the laws of Newtonian physics, making "said laws of nature" in statement 2t unable to refer to anything.

One can accept statement 2w and reject statement 2t. If one neither accepts nor rejects statement 2w, if one maintains that one does not know whether or statement 2w is true, one can still reject statement 2t.

My view is that I can't accept or reject statement 2w because I don't have the knowledge to say whether it's true or false. Why's that?

For starters, Newtonian physics is known to be correct only in restricted contexts and to a certain degree of approximation. Newtonian physics was formulated by inductive generalization from a certain body of phenomena, namely the motions of objects that can be seen with the naked eye. When it comes to very small objects, very large scale phenomena, very high speeds, very high energy levels, etc., Newtonian physics ceases to be correct and other theories, like quantum physics and general relativity, are required to get the right answers. Quantum physics and general relativity, in turn, have proven extremely difficult to unify into a single logically consistent theory. All of this suggests that Newtonian physics, as well as all existing theories, represent only our best current state of understanding. This casts doubt on the idea of assuming that the laws of Newtonian physics as described by physicists are direct correlates of objective laws of nature, rather than being human constructions that approximate the actual behavior of nature to a high degree of accuracy in a wide yet limited variety of cases.

Here is an additional reason to doubt statement 2w. As Kant has argued in the *Critique of Pure Reason*, we cannot have direct knowledge of the world outside ourselves. Our sense perceptions and experiences are constructions of our minds which are presumed to reflect an outside world through many layers of indirection, through processes such as light transmission, retinal stimulation, edge detection, object detection, associative cognition, etc. Our theories of the world are abstractions over our observations, i.e. generalizations over series of sense perceptions had by humans over time. Then can we, with intellectual fairness, assume that the outside world, a thing of which we have no direct experience, is made in the image of our models of the outside world?

Statement 2w is in doubt on multiple fronts, and probably most are not willing to assume it's true. Hence, we should not assume statement 2t makes sense. Hence, we should not follow it as a terminological rule. In other words, we should not understand the phrase "the laws of Newtonian physics" to refer to objective laws of nature correlating to the laws of Newtonian physics as described by humans.

Instead, in this text we will use the phrase "the laws of Newtonian physics" to refer to said human-constructed descriptions, or to the ideas those descriptions denote.

The same problem we have encountered with Newtonian physics occurs with other phrases that refer either to laws or nature or to human-constructed descriptions of supposed laws of nature. Examples of phrases presenting this problem include "the laws of general relativity," "the laws of quantum mechanics," "the laws of chemistry," "the laws of biology," etc. In all such cases, in this text we shall interpret the phrases as referring to human constructed descriptions of laws, or to the ideas expressed by those descriptions, and not to objective laws of nature. This is, as with the case of the laws of Newtonian physics, not an attempt to say that there aren't corresponding objective laws of nature (though many of the same difficulties with asserting positively the existence of such laws present themselves in other cases). It's simply a terminological choice driven by the desire not to take a position on what objective laws of nature exist.

This terminological choice collapses a substantive distinction in meaning we've seen between the terms "rule" and "law," namely that "law" can refer to laws of nature whereas "rule" seems to refer to the rules of humans. Under our sharpened terminology, the natural laws we know (the laws of physics, chemistry, etc.) are just a kind of rule. For example, the laws of Newtonian physics are the rules of the game of Newtonian physics. Newtonian physics is a gamelike activity that humans practice in order to build bridges, go to the moon, etc. Similarly for the rest of natural science.

Do any distinctions in meaning remain for us between "rule" and "law?" Let's consider the case of the laws of legal systems of nations, states, municipalities, etc, or "legal laws" as we shall say. Are legal laws rules? It seems natural to say so. By our principles, that means that legal laws are rules that apply in the context of some game or gamelike activity. The contexts that the laws of a legal system apply to are all situations in the jurisdiction of the legal system about which laws have been made in the given legal system.

In what ways are situations to which legal laws apply like games, and in what ways are they unlike games? Situations to which legal laws apply are always like games in the respect that in them one is required to follow rules. Since laws can be made about anything, situations about which there are legal laws can be arbitrarily non-gamelike. Let's ask, then, about the gamelike and non-gamelike characteristics of typical situations about which there are legal laws.

Let's start with violence. Most forms of violence are illegal in most jurisdictions. Violence is not a very gamelike thing. What laws against violence say is that one should never commit (covered forms of) violence. In other words, laws against violence require people to follow the rule of non-violence in most of their dealings. In what ways is non-violence like a game, and in what ways is it unlike a game?

Non-violence postulates certain rules, which vary depending on who you're asking. These rules usually amount to prohibitions on violating the bodies of other people, where violating the bodies of other people ranges from violations such as touching somebody without permission to violations such as mangling a person limb from limb. These rules serve the purpose of preventing people from being harmed and maintaining social cohesion by prohibiting interpersonal conflicts from escalating to the point of violence. Rules of non-violence are based on the observation, long validated by history, that violence almost always leads to consequences more deplorable than the problems it was trying to solve.

The following suggests itself: non-violence is part of the rules we follow in the game of society. On this way of thinking, society is a game humans play whose purposes include the survival and reproduction of the society and its members. Different societies are different games with different rules. However, all of the ones I'm aware of include rules against violence, because games of society accomplish their purposes better when such rules are instituted.

We can immediately generalize this answer as follows. Legal laws are among the rules of the social game that the members of a society play in order to constitute that society.

Thus far we have gotten rid of two distinctions between laws and rules. We have terminologically separated objective laws of nature out of usages of the term "law" in its unqualified usage. We have also categorized legal laws as rules (of the social games that members of a society play in order to constitute that society). Aside from the qualifier that objective laws of nature are obviously laws in some sense, can we draw any distinction between laws and rules within the terminological framework we have set up? It seems not; within our terminological framework, laws (in the unqualified sense) seem to be a type of rules in every case.

It still feels odd to speak of the "laws of chess." At the point we've arrived at, we have no substantive distinction between rules and laws, but there is still a distinction of habitual application of the two terms to different things. The laws of Newtonian physics are rules we are happy to call laws. The rules of chess, not so much. In general, we seem to apply the term "law" to rules that cover a larger jurisdiction than other rules.

Let's summarize what we've said about rules up to this point. Rules are defined and established by humans. Pretty much anything can follow rules. Games have rules, and rules occur in the context of games and gamelike activities. There is no substantive difference in meaning between "rule" and "law," understanding the unqualified term "law" to exclude laws of nature (but to include human-constructed descriptions thereof). Laws are a kind of rule, but the term "law" isn't applied to all rules, but only to certain rules whose jurisdictions are particularly wide.

So far we have established some relationships between rules and other things: rules are related to the humans who make them, the games they're part of, and the things that follow them. However, we have not yet examined in enough detail what rules are in themselves. What are rules?

It's not useful to answer this question by giving a dictionary definition of "rule." "Rule" is such a central, basic concept in human thought that explaining it in terms of simpler concepts is impossible. Instead, we need to explain what rules are in a much more indirect fashion, by examining the concept of rules, as it's used in practice, from many different angles.

Essentially any rule can be written in the form of a statement (possibly a very long one). The statement of a rule says what is true in the context of the rule if the rule is followed. When what the rule says isn't true, we say the rule has been broken.

Rules are of two types: **descriptive rules** and **prescriptive rules**. The statement of a descriptive rule states that empirically, the statement of a rule holds true. The laws of Newtonian physics are examples of descriptive rules. The statement of a prescriptive rule, on the other hand, states that people should choose to follow the rule. Legal laws are examples of prescriptive rules.

Anybody can state a descriptive rule. Descriptive rules can be correct or incorrect in a few different ways. If the statement of a descriptive rule is true in all cases, the rule is universally correct. If the statement of a descriptive rule is true in the great majority of cases, with rare exceptions, the rule is correct as a generalization. Descriptive rules that only hold in some cases are also interesting, but probably "rule" isn't the best word for them; maybe "pattern" is better. A descriptive rule is correct or incorrect regardless of who states it. There is no authority besides reality on what descriptive rules are correct.

Prescriptive rules work a little differently. Anybody can state prescriptive rules, but typically they need to persuade others to consent to follow them, which others are typically free not to do. Prescriptive rules are also made by various rulemaking entities with self-proclaimed and recognized authority based on consensus and/or force. Examples of these include governments, international organizations like the UN and the EU, standards organizations like ISO and ANSI, and so forth.

Prescriptive rules can only be about human behavior. Descriptive rules can be about people or things, but descriptive rules about people will never hold universally, because humans have freedom of choice.

Dictionaries are examples of sets of descriptive rules about human behavior. Dictionaries describe the senses of words as most commonly used by English speakers. However, English speakers can and occasionally do use words in senses not described in dictionaries.

Dictionaries can also be thought of as sets of prescriptive rules, for example if you're of the opinion that people ought to spell words the way they're found in the dictionary, or if you're of the opinion that people ought to use words that are in the dictionary only in senses defined in the dictionary.

## Winning

Let's return to a question we asked a ways back. What is winning? At the start of the section we asked whether winning always happens to people in the context of some game. If true, this would be an interesting generalization that would let us apply the philosophy of games to understanding winning.

What seems to be the case is that **winning always occurs in the context of some game or gamelike activity**. "Game or gamelike activity" is, as we have seen, a very broad category, taking in things as disparate as soccer, capitalism, and life. For that reason, it's not a very strong claim to say that winning always occurs in the context of some game or gamelike activity. We'll assume this generalization going forward.

What is winning? Winning is some kind of condition which a player of a game, or a participant of a gamelike activity, can obtain or be in. Typically it's a condition defined by the rules of the game or activity. In typical cases, the conditions for winning are defined by the (explicit) rules of the game, and there is rarely question about whether and when somebody has won the game. However, these generalizations belie some complexities.

Consider, again, winning at life. Whether somebody is winning at life can only be said relative to some frame of evaluation.

For example, consider a person who amassed great wealth through ethically dubious yet legal means. From a straightforwardly capitalist point of view, we might say they were winning at life, because they are amassing wealth in the free market. From a Christian pont of view, we would probably say they were not winning at life. The Christian judgment can be based on the belief that life is a game where the object is to seek the way of Christ, which the wealthy person in our example is not doing. These two frames of evaluation, capitalism and Christianity, provide two very different perspectives on whether the person of the example is winning at life.

Consider, as a further example, somebody who lived an impoverised life in a rural region of the world where they farmed, gained religious education, gained training as a warrior, and died young in combat. From some frames of evaluation, one could say this person had an underprivileged and ultimately oppressed life where their future as an individual was subjugated to the nonsensical needs of a national war machine. From some other frames of evaluation, one could say that this person led a virtuous and spiritual life which culminated in the honor of dying in a fight for that which is sacred. Again, each of these narratives provides very different conclusions as to whether this person is winning at life.

For any life you can describe, you can imagine multiple frames of evaluation which provide different conclusions about whether the liver of that life was winning. This is to say that facts alone are not sufficient to determine a judgment of winning at life or not winning at life. One also needs some additional ingredient, what we are generically calling a frame of evaluation.

Winning at life, in this respect, is unlike winning at most games, in that fair observers will frequently disagree about whether somebody is winning at life, whereas for most games, fair observers will almost always agree about who the winner of the game is and whether there is a winner. This disanalogy is an interesting conceptual disconnect that seems worth working out, to see what can be learned.

The disanalogy also reminds us of a question we asked a ways back and still haven't answered: is (human) life a game? To illustrate the silliness of this particular question, let's ask a more basic question: is human life a gamelike activity? To ask this is to ask whether human life is like games, especially typical games. The answer to this is that life is like them in some ways (e.g., you have to follow rules), and unlike them in other ways (e.g., most games don't inevitably end in death, whereas all lives do). Life is therefore both gamelike and non-gamelike, and it's arguably or partially correct and arguably or partially incorrect, and correct in inexhaustibly many possible ways in inexhaustibly many instances, and incorrect in inexhaustibly many other possible ways in inexhaustibly many other instances, to call life a game and to call it not a game. As a shorter way of saying this, we will say, life is and is not a game.

TODO: In above paragraph... a difference between games and life is that life ends in the end of life and games end in the end of games? Can we name a difference between life and games?

If life is and is not a game, then you might expect that winning at life both is and is not possible, in different senses. We have already seen this to be the case. Winning at life is not possible in the sense that there is no objective, agreed upon standard by which to judge whether somebody won at life. Winning at life is possible in the sense that there are inexhaustibly many frames of evaluation from which one can apply the judgment that a certain course of action did lead to or is likely to lead to winning at life.

Of course, the most practical case is the case where one adopts a certain frame of evaluation as a frame of evaluation one routinely applies to one's own life, and then one proceeds to attempt to win at life according to the standards of that frame of evaluation. Almost everybody does this to some extent.

People apply many different frames of evaluation to many different parts of their lives as their lives go on. These frames of evaluation generally evolve over time. Conflicts often exist, where different frames of evaluation applied simultaneously or at different times yield conflicting conclusions. This can lead to regret about past decisions, a sense of turmoil and inner conflict in one's present, etc.

If one wants to do something resembling winning at life, then it's clearly necessary to unify multiple conflicting frames of evaluation that one applies to one's life into a single frame of evaluation, which can and should evolve over time. The reason this is necessary is that without a unified frame of evaluation to judge success and therefore guide decision making, one's decisions won't move one's life in a consistent direction, and rather than reaping the rewards that come from pursuing a well strategized life, one may instead drift about without ever finding lasting success. This does not argue against drifting about for a time in life; this can be helpful for learning, self discovery, and so forth. It just argues that if one's interested in something resembling winning at life, then one should be interested in the pursuit of coherence in and the working out of contradictions between the frames of evaluation that one applies to one's life and one's choices, and in the eventual development of a philosophy and direction in life if one lacks those things in good measure.

We have analyzed the concept of winning at life at some length. Let's now turn back to the general concept of winning. To understand winning better, it would be interesting to have a theory of winning which might explain some of the confusing observations we've made, such as that there are so many different, incompatible frames of evaluation with which to judge winning and losing at life.

Our theory of winning is as follows: **to win is to achieve a purpose one has in a game or gamelike activity**.

Typically, when one is explicitly declared the winner of a game, this means that one has won according to the rules of the game, or in other words that one has achieved the explicit purpose stated in the rules of the game. We'll call this **explicit winning**.

When one achieves an implicit purpose one has in playing a game, this typically carries the feeling of victory, but if the purpose is implicit then the celebration will typically also be implicit, meaning in this case internal. We'll call achieving an implicit purpose in a game **implicit winning**.

In most cases, when we talk about winning, we're talking about explicit winning. However, it certainly seems that success in life is not predicated on others' awareness of one's intentions, so that it seems unreasonable to discount implicit winning as a form of winning.

We can think of many examples of implicit winning. One is playing chess with a potential romantic interest and accomplishing the implicit purpose of having meaningful and pleasant social interaction with them, perhaps in addition to the explicit purpose of winning the game. Another example of implicit winning is taking care of some financial chores and accomplishing the implicit purpose of increasing one's sense of financial confidence, in addition to the explicit purpose of refinancing one's debt or whatever it was. Another example of implicit winning is finishing a job at work and doing it well, accomplishing the implicit purpose of giving one's life purpose and giving oneself a reason for self-pride in a job well done, as well as the explicit purpose of fulfilling one's work obligations.

Now let's pick at our theory and see how it does and what it says in various circumstances. TODO

## Winning arguments and winning debates

Having analyzed the concept of winning, we can now shed more light on the concepts of winning arguments and winning debates. We are back where we were at the start of the Introduction, at our attempt to explain the meaning of the title, Winning Arguments.

In the first three paragraphs of the Introduction, we distinguished between two senses of "winning arguments," corresponding to two senses of "argument," i.e. "argument" in the sense of "debate," and "argument" in the sense of "a series of statements designed to provide reason to believe some conclusion(s)." We refer to the former as debates and the latter as arguments.

Thus, we have two concepts stated by the title, both of which we need to analyze: the concept of winning arguments, and the concept of winning debates. "A winning argument," we presumed, means essentially "a persuasive argument;" but a deeper conceptual analysis of the phrase remains to be done. "Winning debates" refers to the activity of winning in debates.

Let's start by digging deeper into the concept of winning debates. The phrase "winning debates" presupposes that debates are a kind of game or gamelike activity. Are they? Well, are debates like games? Let's ask some more questions that shed light on that.

Recall we defined debates to be "exchanges of communication where participants discuss with each other the merits and demerits of some claims that they are mutually interested in and believe themselves to disagree about."

Are debates competitive? Typically so, as participants compete to persuade other participants of their point of view. Are debates cooperative? Yes, in the sense that to engage in a coherent debate, participants need to understand each others' statements and respond with relevant, appropriate statements.

Do debates follow rules? As we have noted before, participants in a debate are usually free to say whatever they want. As such there are no descriptive rules (about the speech of participants) that all debates can be observed to follow. Similarly, there is no rulemaking authority with the power to enforce prescriptive rules applying to all debates. In short, there are no rules that all debates follow. Nor do we have any reason to expect in the future that there will be such rules.

Debates can, however, be observed to follow rules. For example, the speech within debates generally follows rules of grammar and so forth. Other rules of interest applying to debates include rules of logic, rules of politeness and common decency, and other norms governing linguistic communication, such as [Grice's conversational maxims](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html). As we have already observed, none of these rules are always followed in debates. However, they are often followed. Perhaps more interestingly, following these rules, along with various other widely accepted rules of language use and debate, tends to help one win debates. Why this is the case, and what it means to win debates, are questions that we haven't fully addressed, either in this text or as a species. We will do our best to investigate.

Debates are evidently fairly gamelike. This renders palatable the usage of the phrase "winning debates." What is it to win a debate? We have said that to win is to achieve a purpose one has in a game or gamelike activity. Therefore, one can be said to win a debate if one achieves a purpose one has in it.

People can have many different purposes in a debate. Here are some examples of purposes that people can have in speaking in debates:

* To persuade others of a certain point of view on a topic.
* To determine the truth about a topic.
* To be included in the social group having the debate.
* To impress others with one's intelligence and rhetorical skill, and thereby increase one's social status.
* To blow off steam.
* To humiliate one's debate opponents.

Here are some examples of purposes that people can have in listening to debates:

* To learn about the topic and/or form one's opinion on it.
* To learn about the participants in the debate.
* To be included in the social group having the debate.
* To be entertained.

Debates can have a variety of different structures. The most common structure might be the **two-fixed-opposed-sides debate**, which has the following characteristics:

* Two positions are being debated.
* The two positions are (believed by the participants to be) incompatible with each other, meaning that one cannot coherently hold both positions at the same time. In a common special case, the two positions hold that a certain proposition is true or is false, respectively.
* The positions being debated do not change throughout the course of the debate.
* The side that each speaking participant is arguing for does not change throughout the course of the debate.

Another structure, which contrasts in interesting ways with the two-fixed-opposed-sides debate, is the **truth-seeking debate**, which has the following characteristics:

* An open-ended set of positions are being debated.
* Participants do not have any fixed outcome in mind for the debate and are prepared to change their minds as a result of the debate.
* Participants may change their positions at any time and as many times as they choose.
* Participants may refrain from holding a position.

There are, of course, going to be debates which fit neither of these descriptions. However, these two forms of debates seem to be some of the most common and workable debate structures.

These two structures have substantially different conditions for winning, because they have substantially different purposes. In the two-fixed-opposed-sides debate, generally the participants share the assumption that exactly one of the two positions is correct, and the condition for winning, as understood by the debate participants, is typically more or less to establish to the satisfaction of the observers of the debate that one's own side has the more persuasive arguments in its favor. The purpose of a two-fixed-opposed-sides debate is usually to establish dominance of one of the two positions over the other.

In a truth-seeking debate, the purpose and therefore the conditions for winning are quite different. The purpose is not to establish dominance of one position over another. Usually, the purpose is to arrive at a consensus that a certain position represents the truth on the topic of interest. If every participant's principal purpose was to reach such consensus, then when consensus is achieved, we can say that everybody has won, because everybody has achieved their principal purpose. On the other hand, if consensus is not reached, then we would probably say nobody has won, because nobody has achieved their principal purpose. In short, the goal of a truth-seeking debate is consensus rather than dominance, and in a truth-seeking debate everybody wins or doesn't win together, rather than one side winning and another losing.

The foregoing comments give us some idea of what it means to win debates. There are many different kinds of debates where different kinds of winning are possible, but we have at least a basic grip on that diversity at this point. Now we have fulfilled one of our first objectives in the introduction, which was to explain the phrase "winning debates."

Let's now turn to the companion phrase "winning arguments." Recall we defined "argument" as "a series of statements designed to provide reason to believe some conclusion(s)." We concluded on cursory inspection that the phrase "winning arguments" means something like "persuasive arguments." Can we dig into the meaning of this phrase more deeply?

A winning argument is an argument which wins. What does that mean? Basically it has to mean, the argument wins in some debates. Arguments are not useful for much besides debating. So a winning argument is an argument which a person can use to win debates. To win in a debate is to accomplish a purpose one has in a debate. Therefore, what is a winning argument for you will depend on what your purposes are. To teach ourselves to produce winning arguments, therefore, means within our nomenclature to teach ourselves to produce arguments to accomplish whatever purposes we may have in debates.

Accomplishing the purpose(s) one has in a debate generally entails persuading others of a point of view, and/or exchanging ideas in a way which appears to move oneself and/or others closer to the truth. Arguments, certainly, are great not only as tools to persuade others of a pre-conceived point of view, but also and even more so as tools to explore conceptual space, acting as guides to move us forward towards the truth.

Speaking practically, I would say that the following two rules are the most important rules of winning debates:

**1. Be right.**

There is little it's better to have on your side in a debate than the truth.

The most important rule for winning debates is to **avoid getting into debates that you are going to lose in the first place.** If you'd like to build a reputation as somebody who speaks the truth, you should think before you speak and not get into debates that you are going to lose.

If you are just learning to win debates, that is basically the opposite of what you should do. If you are just learning to win debates, you would do well to be willing to get into any debate, defend any position, and not worry too much about being wrong. When you're learning to debate, just take advantage of opportunities to practice.

Skilled debaters still need to practice to stay skilled. However, skilled debaters probably have a highly developed skill of playing out debates in their head, and the amount of practice they need debating with others is likely to be reduced by their ability to practice in their head. (Most people probably have debates in their head. However, inexperienced debaters probably won't be able to anticipate the arguments that would be leveled against their positions in a real debate.)

If you're going to debate people in a fixed-opposed-sides format, then you should make sure that your side is the one that is correct, and then you've taken the first step towards winning. If you're going to engage in a truth-seeking debate, just make sure that's also the purpose of your debate partners, and you don't need to worry about losing.

**2. Prepare.**

Many forms of preparation are required to be an impressive debater on a topic. One needs general facility with language and the techniques of debate. One needs background knowledge on the subject matter of debate. One needs a thorough knowledge of the various arguments for and against the position one wants to argue for. And it should be the case that taken all together, those arguments favor one's own position. This will always be a matter of judgment, and in many cases the best one can hope for is that the arguments will favor one's position in most people's judgment.

You can generally assume your preparation for a debate won't be satisfactory, unless perhaps you overmatch your opponents in correctness on the debate topic and in debating skill. Your debate partners will likely bring up arguments you didn't think of, and these arguments may create big problems for your view. Hold great respect for what your debate partner knows that you don't know, because you don't know what they know.

We are usually overconfident in our own beliefs, which translates into overconfidence that we will win a debate, retrospective overconfidence that we did win a debate, etc. When we notice our own overconfidence in our beliefs, we can over-correct and end up with under-confidence in what we know. Training away our overconfidence in our beliefs and finding a balanced degree of confidence in each belief that we hold is the work of a lifetime.










## Statements

The first three paragraphs of the Introduction explained the meaning of the title, and the entirety of the text since then has been an attempt to explain the meaning of the first three paragraphs of the Introduction. Back in the Introduction, I gave a series of words from the first three paragraphs that needed explanation:

> Let's return to our original task of clarifying the meaning of the first three paragraphs of this Introduction. So far we've clarified the meanings of two critical words, "debate" and "argument." Yet many words of nebulous, dubious, or unclear meaning remain. First and foremost, "winning," but also (with the evident nebulousness, dubiousness or unclarity depending in part on where and how deep you've traveled into philosophy) "true," "reason," "believe," "persuasive," and "statement." Let's analyze the meanings of these words, starting with "winning."

We've done our analysis of "winning," but the rest of these words remain to be analyzed: "true," "reason," "believe," and "statement." In this section we shall analyze the word "statement."

What is a statement? A statement is a kind of sentence. Here are some dictionary definitions of "statement" that I looked up on Google:

* a definite or clear expression of something in speech or writing.
* an official account of facts, views, or plans, especially one for release to the media.
* a formal account of events given by a witness, defendant, or other party to the police or in a court of law.

The study of winning arguments is mostly a study of statements and the relationships between statements. Therefore, we should take care to develop a good understanding of statements.

Logicians frequently provide various definitions of the word "statement." In this text, we shall use the following definition of the word "statement." **A statement is a sentence which can be believed or disbelieved.** This definition picks out a certain wide class of sentences, spanning across all natural languages and many formal languages. This class probably agrees in essential intent, if not in actual [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(semantics)), with most modern logicians' definitions of "statement."

Here are some examples of statements:

* I am cold.
* This is a pen.
* It is early in the morning.
* After we harvest the wheat we will store it in the silos.
* Within the lives of others we can find some of the most important insights about ourselves.
* Every statement is either true or false.
* If the axioms of math can prove themselves to be incapable of proving any statement about numbers to be both true and false, then the axioms of math can prove any statement about numbers.
* 2+2=4.
* 2+2=5.

Here are some examples of sentences that are not statements:

* Why am I cold?
* Get over here!
* Fuck you!
* Help!

"Why am I cold?" is a question. "Get over here!" and "help!" are imperative sentences. An [imperative sentence](https://www.thoughtco.com/imperative-sentence-grammar-1691152) is "a type of sentence that gives advice or instructions or that expresses a request or a command." "Fuck you!" can be literally interpreted as an imperative sentence (telling the target to fuck themselves). However, "fuck you!" is perhaps better thought of as an [ejaculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation_(grammar)). Clearly, none of these sentences can be believed or disbelieved. For example, I make no sense if I say, "I believe that why am I cold?" or "I believe that fuck you!" Since they can't be believed or disbelieved, "why am I cold?" and "fuck you!" are not statements; similarly with "help!"

Statements, like other sentences, tend to follow rules of grammar. Rules of grammar vary between languages, but there are various common themes. The full complexity of grammar is manifest in the grammar of statements. The grammar of statements, which is the study of grammar minus the grammar of non-statement sentences, is an interesting study in its own right. In addition, an understanding of the grammar of statements is important background knowledge for what follows. Therefore, our next step in understanding statements is to embark on a study of the grammar of statements.

There are many approaches to the study of grammar. Indeed, there are a number of different kinds of grammatical theory of note:

* A **natural language grammar** attempts to describe the grammar of a natural language.
  * A **descriptive natural language grammar** attempts to describe the rules of grammar actually followed (in ordinary cases) by some population of language speakers.
  * A **prescriptive natural language grammar** defines the rules of grammar that some population of speakers should use, at least according to the author(s) of the grammar.
* A **formal grammar** exactly describes the grammar of an artificial language, a so-called **formal language**. Formal grammars are usually written in notation with precise, formal meaning, which renders it entirely unambiguous what does and does not constitute valid syntax for a statement of the formal language.
* A **theory of grammar** is a theory which says something about grammars as a whole, or about some restricted class of grammars. For instance, if one wishes to explain the concept of formal grammars in a thorough way, then this requires a theory of formal grammars. The [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy) is an example of a precise theory of formal grammars, explaining what a formal grammar is and categorizing them according to how difficult it is to parse statements in them.

There is a lot of interesting stuff to unpack here. Let's start by learning a simple formal language of statements. We're going to explain how to write statements in a toy language whose only sentences are statements. This language is called **(the language of) first-order logic**. First-order logic is notable in that it has an extremely simple grammar, and essentially any statement can be expressed in first-order logic.

Our presentation of first-order logic is notationally different from most other presentations of first-order logic, in that we opt to use English words in place of logical symbols, making the notation more naturally readable for English speakers, but less compact.

In essence the version of first-order logic we present should be equivalent to all other presentations of first-order logic, despite many superficial differences. The reader can, as an exercise, find another presentation of first-order logic and find for themselves the reasons why that system is for all intents and purposes interchangeable with ours, despite their differences. Our presentation differs in tricky ways (as well as simple ways) from most presentations of first-order logic, so that this can be an interesting exercise for a student of mathematical logic.

Here are some examples of statements in our version of first-order logic:

* (*a* is a dog)
* ((*a* is a dog) and (*a* runs))
* (for all *a*, (if (*a* is Santa Claus) then (*a* is a North Pole inhabitant)))
* (for all *a*, (if (*a* is a person) then (for some *b*, ((*b* is a person) and (*b* loves *a*)))))

As you can see, these statements look a lot like statements in English, but not quite. Let's go through the rules that define the grammar of this language.

There are three kinds of words in (our presentation of) first-order logic: variable names, predicates, verbs, and connective words.

* For **variable names** we will use single italicized lower case letters: *a*, *b*, *c*...
* For **object literals** we will use English phrases denoting objects, e.g. "the President of the United States" or "this chicken." The latter example illustrates that English phrases denoting objects can be context-sensitive in meaning.
* For **predicates** we will use upper case letters (P, Q, R, ...) and ordinary English phrases denoting categories of objects, specific objects, or properties (e.g. "a dog," "the President of the United States," "clean").
* For **verbs** we will use ordinary English verbs, e.g. "loves." 
* The following are all the **connective words:** **if**, **then**, **and**, **or**, **not**, **for**, **all**, **some**, **is**.

An **object term** (of our presentation of first-order logic) is a variable name or an object literal. In other words an object term is any piece of syntax that can denote an object.

We will also need notations for variables ranging over different types of words:

* When we need a variable that ranges over object terms, i.e. an *object meta-variable*, we will use bolded lower case letters starting with "a": **a**, **b**, **c**, ...
* When we need a variable that ranges over predicates, i.e. a *predicate variable*, we will use bolded upper case letters starting with "P": **P**, **Q**, **R**, ...
* When we need a variable that ranges over statements, i.e. a *statement variable*, we will use bolded upper case letters starting with "A": **A**, **B**, **C**, ...
* When we need a variable that ranges over verbs, we will use a bolded lower case **v**.

A **lexical unit** (of our presentation of first-order logic) is a word, a parenthesis, or a comma.

A **statement** (of our presentation of first-order logic) is any sequence of lexical units which can be formed according to the following rules:

1. If **a** is an object term and **P** is a predicate, then (**a** is **P**) is a statement.
3. If **a** is an object term and **v** is a verb, then (**a** **v**) is a statement.
4. If **a** and **b** are object terms and **v** is a verb, then (**a** **v** **b**) is a statement.
5. If **A** is a statement, then (not **A**) is a statement.
6. If **A** is a statement and **B** is a statement, then:
    * (if **A** then **B**) is a statement.
    * (**A** and **B**) is a statement.
    * (**A** or **B**) is a statement.
7. If **A** is a statement and **a** is a variable name, then:
    * (for all **a**, **A**) is a statement.
    * (for some **a**, **A**) is a statement.

Let us show how these grammar rules can be used to derive the examples we gave above of statements:

**(*a* is a dog) is a statement.**

* *a* is a variable name.
* "a dog" is a predicate (denoting a category).
* By rule 1, (*a* is a dog) is a statement.

**((*a* is a dog) and (*a* runs)) is a statement.**

* *a* is a variable name.
* "runs" is a verb.
* By rule 2, (*a* runs) is a statement.
* (*a* is a dog) is a statement (see above).
* By rule 5, ((*a* is a dog) and (*a* runs)) is a statement.

**(for all *a*, (if (*a* is Santa Claus) then (*a* is a North Pole inhabitant))) is a statement.**

* *a* is a variable name.
* "Santa Claus" is a predicate (denoting an object).
* By rule 1, (*a* is Santa Claus) is a statement.
* "a North Pole inhabitant" is a predicate (denoting a property).
* By rule 1, (*a* is a North Pole inhabitant) is a statement.
* By rule 5, (if (*a* is Santa Claus) then (*a* is a North Pole inhabitant)) is a statement.
* By rule 6, (for all *a*, (if (*a* is Santa Claus) then (*a* is a North Pole inhabitant))) is a statement.

The reader should understand the foregoing to the extent that they can produce an unlimited number of statements in first-order logic; produce for each of them derivations conforming to the pattern we have demonstrated; and distinguish between valid and invalid syntax for statements of first-order logic.

The reader should also understand what statements in first-order logic. For the most part, this may be fairly self-evident, but it is worth taking a moment to clarify explicitly what each form of statement means:

* (**a** is **P**) means that whatever object **a** denotes in the current context has the property **P**, belongs to the category of objects **P**, or is the object **P**.
* (**a** **v**) and (**a** **v** **b**), where **v** is a verb and **a** and **b** are variable names, means that the corresponding English statement is true for whatever values the variable(s) have in the current context.
* (**A** and **B**) means that **A** and **B** are both true.
* (**A** or **B**) means that at least one of **A** or **B**, and possibly both, are true. The "or" in first-order logic is therefore an *inclusive or*. This can be distinguished from an *exclusive or*, which differs from an inclusive or in that it an exclusive or is false when both disjuncts are true. That is, an exclusive or requires exactly one of its disjuncts to be true, as opposed to at least one as with inclusive or.
* (not **A**) means that **A** is not true.
* (if **A** then **B**) means that if **A** is true, then **B** is true.
* (for all **a**, **A**) means that in any variant on the current context created by setting the object denoted by the variable **a** to some object, **A** is true.
* (for some **a**, **A**) means that in at least one variant on the current context created by setting the object denoted by the variable **a** to some object, **A** is true.

Many connective words/phrases have conventional names:

* **and** is called **conjunction**. A statement of the form (**A** and **B**) can be called **a conjunction**.
* **or** is called **disjunction**. A statement of the form (**A** or **B**) can be called **a disjunction**.
* **not** is called **negation**. A statement of the form (not **A**) can be called **a negation**.
* **if/then** is called **the conditional**. A statement of the form (if **A** then **B**) can be called **a conditional**.
* **for all** is called the **universal quantifier**, and is one of two examples of a **quantifier**. A statement of the form (for all **a**, **A**) can be called **a universally quantified statement** or **a universal statement**.
* **for some** is called the **existential quantifier**, and is one of two examples of **quantifier**. A statement of the form (for some **a**, **A**) can be called **an existentially quantified statement** or **an existential statement**.

The explanations we gave of the meanings of quantified statements explicitly assume the notion of a *context*. The explanations of the meanings of the other statement types implicitly require this notion as well. For the purposes of first-order logic, the context simply determines what objects the variables denote. You can think of a context as a mapping from variable names to objects. Contexts are referred to by various names in the study of logic, with "variable assignment" being one term in use. In some presentations of first-order logic, every variable name is required to be given a value by a context, while in other presentations, a context might give values only to some variables. In the latter case, statements containing references to variables not enclosed by quantifiers over those variables will be uninterpretable in a given context if that context does not assign values to those variables.

We will not attempt to further formalize this explanation of the meaning of the statements of first-order logic at this time. At this point it's hoped that the reader understands the meaning of statements of first-order logic in an informal way which enables them to read such statements. There are many intricacies to explore regarding the meanings of statements of first-order logic, but we will defer this discussion for the sections on Truth and Reasons.

TODO: Exercises

Earlier we made the claim that essentially any statement can be expressed in first-order logic. Let us now explore this claim. The claim is interesting because if it is true, then we can think of first-order logic as a sort of a theory of statements, an idealized way of thinking about statements as a whole.

First-order logic is not the only formal language about which one may fairly make this claim. There are many formal languages about which one may fairly make this claim. Most of them bear some resemblance to first-order logic. First-order logic is a good example of the category.

The first-order logic statements we have seen, when read aloud, are in essence English sentences (although their use of variable names is not ordinary English). Clearly many English statements are already in essence statements of first-order logic, in the sense that a translation is obvious and closely resembles the original statement. In other cases, varying degrees of rephrasing are required to express an English statement in first-order logic.

In order to investigate further, we shall abandon contrived examples, look at some statements from books that are in my house, and try to translate them into first-order logic.

**This cake is well named, as it has a very delicate consistency.**

Translation: ((this cake is well named) and (this cake is delicate in consistency) and (the statement (this cake is well named) is justified by the statement (this cake is very delicate in consistency)))

Sentence from: Irma S. Rombauer. The Joy of Cooking. Simon & Schuster Inc.

"This cake is well named as it has a very delicate consistency" seems to mean roughly "this cake is well named because it has a very delicate consistency." That is, the sentence expresses three things:

* The cake is well named.
* The cake has a delicate consistency.
* The cake is well named because it has a very delicate consistency.

This third statement is expressing a relationship between the first two statements: namely, that "this cake has a delicate consistency" justifies "this cake is well named." This is reflected in the translation, where the verb "is justified by" relates the two object literals "the statement (this cake is well named)" and "the statement (this cake is delicate in consistency)."

**Every passerby could read the sign, for every passerby could read Hebrew, Latin, or Greek --- the three great languages of the ancient world.**

Translation: ((Latin is a great language of the ancient world) and (Hebrew is a great language of the ancient world) and (Greek is a great language of the ancient world) and (for all x, (if (x is a great language of the ancient world) then ((x is Greek) or (x is Latin) or (x is Hebrew)))) and (for all x, (if ((x is a person) and (x is passing by the sign)) then ((x can read a great language of the ancient world) and (x can read the sign) and (the statement (x can read a great language of the ancient world) justifies the statement (x can read the sign)))))).

Sentence from: Max Lucado. He Chose the Nails. Thomas Nelson.

The size of this translation shows that many different logical propositions are contained in this not-exceptionally-long English sentence.

The hawk-eyed reader may notice that we have taken some liberties with parentheses in this translation. For example, we wrote ((x is Greek) or (x is Latin) or (x is Hebrew)), but technically this statement cannot be produced by our syntax rules, because our syntax rules cannot produce three "or" clauses under one shared set of paretheses. To conform technically to our syntax, the statement must be written with two of the "or" clauses parenthesized together, in one of these two ways (with the added parentheses in bold):

(**(**(x is Greek) or (x is Latin)**)** or (x is Hebrew)

((x is Greek) or **(**(x is Latin) or (x is Hebrew)**)**)

Both of these statements mean the same thing and are true under exactly the same circumstances: namely, when at least one of the three clauses is true. Later we will be able to prove formally that these two statements are true under exactly the same circumstances. 

The other example of us taking liberty with parentheses in this translation is of the same kind, but with "and" instead of "or." The statement as a whole has the form:

((Latin is a great language of the ancient world) and (...) and (...) and (...) and (...))
