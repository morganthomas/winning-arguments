# Winning Arguments

## How to use this text

You can use this text as a practical guide to winning arguments, to reasoning about any subject, to seeking the truth about any subject, and to misleading people about any subject.

The text is an exploration of the theoretical foundations of winning arguments. The same theoretical foundations that explain how to win arguments on any subject also explain how to reason about any subject, how to seek the truth about any subject, and how to mislead people about any subject. The same knowledge can be used for any of these purposes, and it's up to the person who has it to use it responsibly.

The author advises the reader against the use of any techniques to deliberately mislead people, as the author believes misleading people almost invariably leads, in the long haul, to consequences more deplorable than what would have resulted if one told the truth.

The text contains exercises, which the author feels will be likely to further the reader's learning, and which the reader is encouraged to do if they feel it will further their learning. The greatest exercise, of course, is life, where you can fruitfully exercise the skills of reasoning, critical thinking, and argumentation you can learn in this text in almost any context of life.

## Introduction

Winning arguments is what we aim to show how to do in this text. We will show how this can be done by constructing winning arguments. As just illustrated, the phrase "winning arguments" has at least two important senses.

First, "winning arguments" can be interpreted to refer to an activity, the activity of winning arguments, where "argument" here is used in the sense of "debate."

Second, "winning arguments" can be interpreted as a noun phrase, where "argument" is used in the sense of "a series of statements designed to provide reasons to believe some conclusion(s)." In this interpretation of the phrase, "winning" is an adjective, presumably meaning something like "persuasive."

A great deal of importance has been introduced in the preceding three paragraphs, so let's unpack the ideas further.

The first item of importance is the distinction between two senses of the word "argument."

Arguments in the first sense of the word are debates. By "debates," I mean exchanges of communication where participants discuss with each other the merits and demerits of some claims that they are mutually interested in and believe themselves to disagree about.

Arguments in the second sense of the term are series of statements designed to provide reasons to believe some conclusion(s). Henceforth, in this text we will consistently use the term "argument" to refer to arguments in this second sense, and we will use the term "debate" to refer to arguments in the first sense.

### Examples of arguments

Here is an example of an argument:

You shouldn't uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across. [Ioannidis (2005)](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) is a scientific study which claims that most published research findings are false. If you uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across, then you should accept Ioannidis (2005). But if you uncritically accept Ioannidis (2005), then you accept that most scientific studies draw false conclusions. So you shouldn't uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across, because if you do, you can expect to be adopting a lot of false beliefs.

Let's analyze this argument. It seeks to prove that you should not uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies you come across. It proceeds by assuming the opposite of what it seeks to prove, and deriving an absurd result. It grants for the sake of argument that we should uncritically accept the conclusions of all scientific studies we come across. The next move is based on the observation that if somebody thinks that way, you can make them believe anything that's said in a published scientific paper. The next move is to point out a paper, Ioannidis (2005), which will make us believe, under our sake-of-argument assumption, that most scientific studies conclude things that are false. With the further assumption that we should not uncritically accept information that's likely to be false, we can refute the statement that we started out by assuming.

The argument above is an example of a *reductio ad absurdum* argument. A *reductio ad absurdum* argument, in a strict sense, is one that proceeds by assuming the negation of its conclusion, and deriving a logical contradiction thereby. In a looser sense, a *reductio ad absurdum* argument can derive, instead of a logical contradiction, an absurd consequence that will probably be unacceptable to the audience of the argument, leading the audience to reject the assumption that leads to that consequence.

The argument above is a *reductio ad absurdum* argument in the looser sense. In the argument above, we first assume the view we wish to refute, and with a modest amount of information and background assumptions, we get to the conclusion that our assumption will likely lead us to accept many false things as true, something which makes most people want to back out of the assumption.

The argument above is an example of a winning argument. I expect the reader agrees: it is hard to disagree with the reasoning, or the conclusion. I haven't encountered anybody who finds this argument unpersuasive. One reason the argument is so strong is the simplicity and effectiveness of its structure, which is based on the *reductio ad absurdum* idea that is the basis of many good arguments stretching back to ancient times.

Let's round out this discussion with an example of an argument which is a *reductio ad absurdum* in the strict sense: that is, an argument which proceeds by assuming the opposite of that which it seeks to prove, and deriving a logical contradiction from that assumption. As our example, we will do an informal version of the classic proof, due to Euclid, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Recall that a prime number is a positive whole number which is divisible only by itself and one. Suppose, towards reaching a contradiction, that there are finitely many prime numbers. Let x be the number resulting from multiplying together all the prime numbers and adding one. Since x is evidently larger than all prime numbers, x is not prime. The fact that x is not prime means, by definition, that x is divisible by at least one prime number. Pick a prime that x is divisible by, and call it p. We know that the remainder of dividing x by p is 0, since that's what it means for x to be divisible by p. However, we also know that the remainder of dividing p by x is 1, because of how we produced x. This is a contradiction, demonstrating that our original assumption was false, or in other words that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Why is it true (at the second to last sentence of the argument) that the remainder of dividing p by x is 1? We produced x by multiplying together all the (finitely many) prime numbers and adding one. Therefore p goes into (x-1) evenly, i.e. the remainder of the division (x-1)/p is zero, and therefore the remainder of the division x/p is 1.

This is another example of a winning argument. Mathematical facts, like the fact that there are infinitely many prime numbers, are extraordinarily uncontroversial. As we will see later, this is because math is a game that has simple and essentially agreed upon rules. By describing math as a game, I do not mean to imply that math is not an activity of seeking truth. I don't mean to take any position in this text on whether or not math is an activity of seeking the truth. Nonetheless, it is clear that correct mathematical proofs are some of the best examples we have of winning arguments.

We've dug a bit into the concept of arguments, in the sense of series of statements designed to provide reasons to believe some conclusion(s). Let's now return to the distinction we made between debates and arguments.

### Arguments and debates

Debates almost always involve the participants making arguments. Can arguments occur anywhere except in the context of debates? 

One place where you can find arguments is in books, especially books about philosophical or political subjects. One can argue that an argument in a book is not in the context of any particular debate, because a book is an inanimate object that can exist in many copies in different places and times. Books are objects which are incapable of participating reciprocally in debates. You can arguably let a book make arguments to you by reading it. You can also respond to the book's arguments, mentally, in your journal, to other people, to the author, etc. But the book cannot respond to your responses to its arguments. The author might be able to, if they're still alive, but that's another issue. This is what I mean when I say that books cannot participate reciprocally in debates. For these and many other reasons, you might say that arguments in books do not necessarily occur in the context of any debate, or perhaps that they never do.

Nonetheless, you might argue that arguments in books usually do occur in the context of some debate or another. This idea is palatable if we accept, as examples of debates, ongoing public debates. An ongoing public debate on a question, roughly, is a situation where lots of people make arguments on and have debates on the question, across a significant slice of space and time, probably across a region or the world for years. If you accept ongoing public debates as examples of debates, then you will probably accept that most arguments in most books occur in the context of some debate.

A possible exception to this generalization is the (hypothetical) case where somebody writes a book which makes arguments on a topic nobody else has discussed, and then nobody reads the book. In this case, you could for the sake of uniformity say that the book occurs in the context of a debate involving one person, the author. However, this might be odd to say because there seems to be something inherently interactive, social, multi-personal about debates. I think most people are going to be inclined to say that the arguments in this book do not occur in the context of any debate.

The possibility of such an exception to the generalization that arguments in books occur in the context of some debate makes more sense when we consider the plausibility of the idea that an argument in a book can occur in the context of multiple debates. For example, a single book about climate change can be involved in the overall public debate on climate change, while simultaneously being involved in many particular interpersonal debates about climate change, each occurring between a specific group of people together in one location in physical space or cyberspace. It seems reasonable to talk in this way and to say that the book is involved in multiple debates on one subject. If the number of debates a book is involved in can vary in number, then it seems only natural that the number could in principle equal zero, though that probably isn't common in reality.

So far we've reached three generalizations about the relationship between arguments and debates:

* Arguments usually occur in the context of debates.
* Debates usually contain arguments.
* Arguments can, in principle, occur outside the context of debates.

In my estimation, all of these points are important. That arguments usually occur in the context of debates, and debates usually contain arguments, tells us that arguments and debates are importantly related to each other and we need to understand them together. That arguments can, in principle, occur outside the context of debates tells us that arguments can be understood independently from debates (though it doesn't tell us whether that's the most useful way to understand them). It's probably not the case, on the other hand, that debates can be understood independently from arguments, since skilled debates are almost always in essence exchanges of arguments.

We will take both of the available approaches to understanding arguments. One can understand arguments either within the context of debates, or independently from debates. We will do both. It's very helpful to study arguments in what we will call the *context-free perspective,* i.e. outside the context of debates. This perspective helps us focus in on arguments' intrinsic properties, and thereby understand arguments much better. However, the perspective is unbalanced if we don't also study arguments in the *contextful perspective*, i.e. in the context of debates as they occur in reality.

Hopefully that discussion of the relationships between debates and arguments has clarified for the reader the distinction between debates and arguments, as well as helping to clarify each concept individually.

Let's return to our original task of clarifying the meaning of the first three paragraphs of this text. So far we've clarified the meanings of two critical words, "debate" and "argument." Yet many words of nebulous, dubious, or unclear meaning remain. First and foremost, "winning," but also (with the evident nebulousness, dubiousness or unclarity depending in part on where and how deep you've traveled into philosophy) "true," "reason," "believe," "persuasive," and "statement." Let's analyze the meanings of these words.

## Winning, and games

What is winning? For starters, winning is most often something that happens to people in the context of games (chess, baseball, etc.).

Question: is winning something that ever happens to people *except* in the context of some game?

Let's consider the phrase "winning at life." Winning at life is a form of winning, at least on a surface inspection of the phrase. One can also hypothesize that "winning at life" is in some usages a phrase with its own particular meaning that doesn't decompose as winning in the context of life, in the same way that a "close shave" doesn't always refer to a shave that was close.

If winning at life is winning in the context of life, and winning only ever happens in the context of some game, then it follows that life is a game. So, then, is life a game? 

"Life is a game" is a truism, a common statement that people are liable to spout as a form of shallow wisdom, perhaps without much reflection on how true it really is. How true is the truism? To answer that, we need to ask, what does the truism mean? To answer that, we need to ask, what do the words in the truism mean? "Life" in the truism seems to refer to human life, and probably it's clear enough what we're referring to there. What about "game?" What is a game?

Let's try to make a start on this question by identifying some things that are games, and also some things that are not games, which fail to be games in ways that are interesting and tell us something about games. A lot of the judgment as to which is which is going to be subjective, but the judgments on particular cases aren't in the end the important thing, but rather what's important is the general picture of games that emerges from the analysis.

Popular and typical examples of games include soccer, chess, poker, dice, solitaire, World of Warcraft, and slot machines. Childrens' games include [peekaboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekaboo), [tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)), [ring around the rosie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_a_Ring_o'_Roses), and two people sitting on the ground and rolling a ball back and forth between each other. Weird, unusual cases of games include [war games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise), the [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games), [Roman gladiatorial combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator), TV game or reality shows such as [The Celebrity Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Celebrity_Apprentice), [Chopped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_(TV_series)#Format), and [Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(game_show)), and abstract theoretical games like the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) which are studied in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). There's a whole category of more analogical usages of "game," such as the game of life, the game of capitalism, the game of courtship and romantic love, and the game of war.

From this list we can immediately state some generalizations that are not true about all games. Not all games are frivolous in purpose; some, such as war games, are serious in purpose. Even games that are superficially frivolous in purpose can be games where you're competing for your own life, as shown by the example of Roman gladiatorial combat. Non-lethal games can involve considerable stakes of money and glory, as exemplified in professional poker and in the Olympic Games.

Roman gladiatorial combat was a game played to entertain people. In that sense it was frivolous in purpose. But, it was gruesome, violent, lethal, and expensive, so presumably there was some significant reason people went to the trouble and difficulty of putting on the games.

One hypothesis I've heard is the following. Rome contained a large class of poor people who lived on welfare and therefore were not occupied with useful work, and it was found to be necessary to entertain them to prevent them from engaging in crime and disruption. If this was the primary purpose of the games for some of the people who funded them, then certainly there was nothing frivolous about the games for those funders. For the people watching the games, the main purpose seems to have been entertainment.

Another hypothesis one can put forth is that the gladiatorial games embodied the Roman values of violence, domination, and heroism, and like most civilizations the Romans felt it was a worthwhile effort to put on events which could stand as monuments to their values. If we think of this as the primary purpose of the games, then one's inclined to say that the purpose is not frivolous, either for the funders or for the audience members.

If you think of the funders and the watchers of the Roman gladiatorial games as different sets of players in the game (expanding the conceptual boundaries of the game beyond the combat ring itself), one can venture that for the funders, the purpose of the games was often not frivolous, whereas for the watchers, the purpose of the games was most often the frivolous purpose of entertainment.

This example illustrates the principle that a game can have multiple purposes, some explicit and some implicit, and different players in a game can have different purposes. The explicit purpose(s) of a game, being explicit, are typically apparent to all. In contrast, probably in almost all cases it's unclear to all or almost all observers of a game what all of the implicit purposes of the game are. This is because implicit purposes are, by definition, not stated, and since we can't read each other's thoughts we have no reliable way of knowing each other's unstated motivations.

Furthermore, people can be unaware of their own motivations. it seems to be the case that most of people's mental activity is unconscious, i.e. not witnessed or observed by their conscious minds, and many psychologists espouse that among people's motivations for things they do, there are their unconscious motivations. Some argue that most or all things we do are influenced at least in part, or even mostly, by unconscious motivations. This is not a psychology text, and we won't try to answer the question of in what ways and to what extent people's behavior is influenced by unconscious motivations. However, if indeed unconscious motivations exist, then we can say that a game may have an implicit purpose of which no observers have any awareness.

Given our limited access to our own minds, and our near lack of access to others' minds, it's clear why probably in almost all cases it's unclear to all or almost all observers of a game what all of the implicit purposes of the game are.

Let's now switch gears and poke at one of the more dubious examples we gave of a game, to see what we can learn about games in the process.

TODO: Explain prisoner's dilemma and address whether it's a game

Let's now switch gears again. Let's give some examples of things that are not games, which fail to be games in interesting ways that might tell us something about games.

Here's an example of a non-game: making toast. If you are a native English speaker: does it sound natural to describe making toast as a game? For me, the answer is that it is not natural. Making toast is not a game. It's some other kind of activity. Food preparation.

Here are some examples of activities that are not usually called games: fixing your toaster; driving to work; working; sleeping; having sex; thinking; conversation; serving on a jury in a court of law; voting. People don't usually call any of these things games, and yet many of them have certain similarities to games. Serving on a jury and voting both have game-like qualities, being group activities governed by socially agreed upon systems of rules within which people make decisions in order to fulfill the objective of the activity (making a fair decision on the case being presented, or electing representatives and resolving plebiscites, respectively). Conversation, and language use in general, have many game-like qualities, being subject to many elaborate, unspoken rules. Game-like activities can be found strewn throughout life if you look for them.
